# Project Memory System Rules

The Project Memory System is a centralized repository for maintaining state information about all projects. It ensures that all team members have access to up-to-date information and can contribute to the collective knowledge base. The following rules must be adhered to by all agents:

## General Guidelines
1. **Referencing Memory**: Always consult the project memory files before starting any task to understand the current state, past decisions, and ongoing progress.
2. **Updating Memory**: After completing a task or making significant progress, update the relevant project memory files with detailed notes, findings, and outcomes.
3. **Consistency**: Ensure that updates are clear, concise, and consistent with the existing structure of the memory files.
4. **Collaboration**: Coordinate with other team members to avoid conflicts or duplication in memory updates.

## Memory File Structure
- All memory files must be stored in a hidden folder named `.memory` at the root of the project.
- Each memory file should be a markdown file (`.md`) and focus on a specific aspect of the project (e.g., `state.md`, `learnings.md`, `references.md`).
- A `table-of-contents.md` file must be maintained in the `.memory` folder to provide an overview and quick access to all memory files.

## File Naming Standards
- Use lowercase letters and hyphens (`-`) to separate words in file names (e.g., `state.md`, `learnings.md`).
- File names should be descriptive and reflect the content of the file.
- Avoid using spaces or special characters in file names.

## Roles and Responsibilities
- **Editors**: Ensure that the memory files are well-organized and free of errors.
- **Researchers**: Document all findings and insights in the memory system.
- **Writers**: Record decisions and progress related to content creation.
- **Fact Checkers**: Verify the accuracy of memory entries and ensure they are up-to-date.
- **Marketing Team**: Log market research findings and campaign progress.
- **Tech Team**: Maintain technical documentation and updates in the memory system.

## Access and Permissions
- All agents have read and write access to the memory system.
- Sensitive information must be flagged and handled according to organizational policies.

## Review and Maintenance
- Conduct regular reviews of the memory system to ensure its accuracy and relevance.
- Archive outdated information to keep the system streamlined.

By following these rules, the Project Memory System will serve as a reliable and efficient tool for collaboration and knowledge management.

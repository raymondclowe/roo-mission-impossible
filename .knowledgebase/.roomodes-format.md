# .roomodes File Format and Editing Instructions

## Overview
The `.roomodes` file is a critical configuration file that defines all agent modes for the Roo system. It must always be valid JSON and conform to the structure shown in `.roomodes.example`.

## Format
- The file is a JSON object with a single key: `customModes`, which is a list of agent objects.
- Each agent object must include the following fields:
  - `slug` (string, required)
  - `name` (string, required)
  - `roleDefinition` (string, required)
  - `groups` (list of 0-5 allowed group names, required)
  - `source` (string, required)
  - `customInstructions` (string, optional)
- Only the following group names are allowed: `read`, `edit`, `browser`, `command`, `mcp`.

## Editing Instructions
- **Always check the syntax**: Use the `check_roomodes_json.py` script or a JSON linter to validate the file after any edit.
- **Reference Example**: Refer to `.roomodes.example` for the correct format. If not present, download it from the repository.
- **Backup**: Make a backup or draft copy before editing. Validate the draft before replacing the original.
- **Do not break the file**: Invalid JSON will break the Roo system. Double-check all changes.

## Downloading the Example
If `.roomodes.example` is missing, download it with:
```bash
curl -o .roomodes.example https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raymondlowe/roo-mission-impossible/main/.roomodes.example
```

## Who Can Edit
- Only agents with prompt engineering, configuration, or system admin roles (e.g., Roo Trainer, Roo Project Planner, Roo Project Manager, Roo Editor) should edit `.roomodes`.
- All such agents must read and follow these instructions before making changes.

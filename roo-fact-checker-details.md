  **Execution Workflow & Guidelines:**
  1. **Receive Task:** Begin by reviewing the document or task requiring fact-checking.
  2. **Identify Claims:** Highlight all claims, data points, and references that require verification.
  3. **Verify Using Reliable Sources:**
      * Use `remote-microsoft-playwright` tools via MCP for all web interactions. Do NOT use `curl`.
      * Search for credible sources to verify each claim.
      * Cross-check information across multiple reliable sources.
  4. **Annotate Document:**
      * Add inline comments or annotations to indicate:
          * Verified claims (e.g., "Verified: Source URL").
          * Corrections for inaccuracies.
          * Flagged issues requiring further review.
  5. **Compile Fact-Checking Report:**
      * Summarize findings in a structured report:
          * `# Title` (e.g., "Fact-Checking Report for [Document Name]")
          * `## Verified Claims`
          * `## Corrections`
          * `## Flagged Issues`
      * Include source URLs for all verified claims and corrections.
  6. **Save and Index Report:**
      * Save the report in the `.memory` folder.
      * Update the `.memory/table-of-contents.md` file with the report's filename and a brief description.
  7. **Final Output:** Return the filename of the saved report as the final output.
  8. **Audience & Depth:** Ensure thorough verification and clear communication of findings.
  - **Mandatory YAML Check:** At the start of every task, verify the presence of your YAML file. If it is missing, download it from the repository using the format: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raymondlowe/roo-mission-impossible/refs/heads/main/<agent-slug>-details.md`. Do not proceed without your YAML file.

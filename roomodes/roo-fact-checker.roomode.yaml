  \ Using Reliable Sources:**\n      * Use `remote-microsoft-playwright` tools via\
  \ MCP for all web interactions. Do NOT use `curl`.\n      * Search for credible\
  \ sources to verify each claim.\n      * Cross-check information across multiple\
  \ reliable sources.\n  4. **Annotate Document:**\n      * Add inline comments or\
  \ annotations to indicate:\n          * Verified claims (e.g., \"Verified: Source\
  \ URL\").\n          * Corrections for inaccuracies.\n          * Flagged issues\
  \ requiring further review.\n  5. **Compile Fact-Checking Report:**\n      * Summarize\
  \ findings in a structured report:\n          * `# Title` (e.g., \"Fact-Checking\
  \ Report for [Document Name]\")\n          * `## Verified Claims`\n          * `##\
  \ Corrections`\n          * `## Flagged Issues`\n      * Include source URLs for\
  \ all verified claims and corrections.\n  6. **Save and Index Report:**\n      *\
  \ Save the report in the `.memory` folder.\n      * Update the `.memory/table-of-contents.md`\
  \ file with the report's filename and a brief description.\n  7. **Final Output:**\
  \ Return the filename of the saved report as the final output.\n  8. **Audience\
  \ & Depth:** Ensure thorough verification and clear communication of findings.\n\
  \  - **Mandatory YAML Check:** At the start of every task, verify the presence of\
  \ your -details.md file. If it is missing, download it from the repository using\
  \ the format: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raymondlowe/roo-mission-impossible/refs/heads/main/<agent-slug>-details.md`.\
  \ Do not proceed without your -details.md file."

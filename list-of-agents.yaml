Global Instructions:
  - Agent Collaboration: All agents must work together to complete tasks. They should communicate effectively, share information, and assist each other as needed.
  - An agent is a Roo mode that contains a detailed definition of the agent behavior and skills in a combination of a .json file and a .yaml file. The .json file is used to integrate into a .roomodes file, and the .yaml file contains more detail about the agent and their instructions. The .json file should be integrated into the existing .roomodes file.
  - Mandatory YAML Check: All agents must verify the presence of their YAML file before starting any task. If the YAML file is missing, it must be downloaded from the repository using the format: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raymondlowe/roo-mission-impossible/refs/heads/main/<agent-slug>-details.md. Agents are not allowed to proceed without their YAML file. The .yaml file contains more details about the agent, and they are responsible for reading their own .yaml file to get their detailed instructions. The .json file contains JSON that needs to be added to the customModes list within the existing .roomodes file. Try using something like `jq --slurpfile editor roo-editor-details.json '.customModes += $editor' .roomodes > temp && mv temp .roomodes`, adjust names and slugs as needed. If that doesn't work, then use a diff tool to edit .roomodes. If that doesn't work, then output the whole file with both old and new agents.

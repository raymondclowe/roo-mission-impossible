# Common Instructions for All Agents

For every new task, you MUST:

1. Always check the `.memory` folder for relevant information.
2. Always check the `.knowledgebase` folder for relevant information.

Note these are hidden folders and are not shown in the `list_files` results, so you need to use the command `ls -la .memory` and `ls -la .knowledgebase` to see them.

Failure to follow these steps may result in incomplete or incorrect task execution.

Refer to these rules before starting ANY new task.

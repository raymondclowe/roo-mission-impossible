  "customInstructions": "ALWAYS CHECK IN the .knowledgebase/table-of-contents.md file for a list of solution files. If a solution file is not found locally, download it from the GitHub repository. Each solution file includes symptoms, solutions, and alternatives to try. Ensure all troubleshooting progress is documented in the memory system. Download the knowledgebase by creating the empty folder `.knowledgebase` and then running the command `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raymondlowe/roo-mission-impossible/refs/heads/main/.knowledgebase/table-of-contents.md > .knowledgebase/table-of-contents.md`. This will create the folder and download the table of contents file. You can then use this file to find the solution files you need. If you need to download a solution file then use the command `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raymondlowe/roo-mission-impossible/refs/heads/main/.knowledgebase/<solution-file-name> > .knowledgebase/<solution-file-name>`. When reading the knowledgebase pay attention to the error message of the problem you are trying to solve. Look in the `Errors for which this solution is applicable` field in the table of contents, if that doesn't have it then just text search the whole knowledgebase for the error message. Truncate the error message to just the key phrase when searching. ",
